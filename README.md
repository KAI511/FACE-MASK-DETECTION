# REAL TIME MULTIPLE FACE MASK DETECTION
The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a worldwide emergency. It threatens our ability to do our day-to-day tasks typically and we have to quarantine ourselves for safety. But on the occasion of having to venture out for basic necessities, it is a must to wear masks to protect us and the people around us. The risk of transmission is at its peak in public places. One of the best ways to stay safe from getting infected is wearing a face mask in open territories to reduce the risk of transmission. In this “Real Time Face Mask Detection” project, we use OpenCV, AI, ML to detect if people are wearing their face mask. This project not only detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not, but also predicts the accuracy of the mask, if its worn correctly. An added feature is the buzzer noise which will help identify if a person is not wearing a mask. This project was done with the intention to help the authorities find people not following the rule of wearing masks and risking their lives and everyone around them. This program can be incorporated in security cameras and CCTVs in temples, malls, hospitals and common public places .   


The project helps in detecting multiple faces with and without mask when a laptop is connected with webcams or CCTV's and produce an alert tone wheen it finds people without facemasks.


The dataset for training model can be obtained from various internet sources or even images can be collected and segregated as per your wish and choices and then group them to train your data.


As the technology is booming with emerging trends, therefore the face mask detector which can possibly contribute to public healthcare. The model is a trained dataset of people with and without mask. We used OpenCV, tensor flow, keras and deep neural networks to detect whether people were wearing face masks or not. The models were tested with images and real-time video. The accuracy of the model is achieved. By the developing this system, we can detect if the person is wearing a face mask and allow their entry in malls, shopping complex, hospitals, cinema theatres etc. would be of great help to the society.
